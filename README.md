I will work on prediction of healthcare expenses. I will use the dateset from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirichoi0218/insurance. The dataset includes 1,338 examples of beneficiaries currently enrolled in the insurance plan, with features indicating characteristics of the patient as well as the total medical expenses charged to the plan for the calendar year. I will explore the relationships between variables and develop a model.# final-project-hanna971130
